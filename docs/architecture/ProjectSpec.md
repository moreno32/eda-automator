# **Project Specification Document: EDA Automator**

## **1. Introduction**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is a critical foundation in the data science workflow that enables practitioners to understand the quality, structure, distribution, and relationships within datasets before proceeding to advanced modeling. The **EDA Automator** is a professional Python library that automates and standardizes the EDA process, allowing data scientists to:
